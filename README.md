# Face-Recognition-Using-KNN
This repo uses open-cv 'Haarcascade frontalface' xml to detect face and then recognizes it using over given dataset using KNN(K nearest neighbour) algorithm

## In order to use this:
->First run face_data_collect.py to collect person's face's data in data folder (press 'q' key to exit window)
->Then simply run face_rocognition.py to see the results (press 'q' key to exit window)
