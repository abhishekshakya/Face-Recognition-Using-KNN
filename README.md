# Face-Recognition-Using-KNN
This repo uses open-cv 'Haarcascade frontalface' xml to detect face and then recognizes it using over given dataset using KNN algorithm

In order to use this:
  first run face_data_collect.py to collect your face's data in datat folder
  then simply runface_rocognition.py to see the result with different faces
